# Testing RIPng and Network Services in GNS3

## 1. Assumptions and Objective

The project assumes an emulated network environment in GNS3 using Cisco routers, with RIPng configured as the dynamic routing protocol. A network service, such as DNS, is deployed to test connectivity. The objective is to observe and analyze the behavior of RIPng in an IPv6 network and to verify that network services remain reachable across the routers.

## 2. Test environment and infrastructure
